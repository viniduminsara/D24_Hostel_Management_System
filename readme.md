# D24 Hostel Management System

The D24 Hostel Management System is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage students, rooms, and
reservations for the D24 Hostel. It utilizes JavaFX and CSS for the frontend, MySQL as the database, and Hibernate as
the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework.

## Features

- **Student Management**: Allows CRUD operations for managing student records, including creating, reading, updating,
  and deleting student information. Students can be registered with their personal details, including name, contact
  information, and campus student ID.
  <br><br>
- **Room Management**: Provides CRUD operations for managing room details, including room types, availability, and
  capacity. Hostel staff can easily add, update, or remove rooms from the system, ensuring accurate information about
  available accommodations.
  <br><br>

  specific time periods. Hostel staff can review and approve these reservations, ensuring efficient allocation of
  available rooms to students.

  staff can easily monitor payment statuses, identify outstanding balances, and generate payment reports.

  access the system.
